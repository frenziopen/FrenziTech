Meshtastic is an open source project that lets you use inexpensive LoRa radios as a long range off-grid communicator for areas without reliable cellular service.
These devices can create a decentralized mesh network that allows users to send text messages and share their location with each other over kilometers/miles .
They can also connect to the internet via relay nodes, enabling online communication as well.
These are equipped with either ESP32 or nRF52 micro-controller units (MCU), which have different features and power consumption levels.
These devices use AES256 encryption to secure the messages, and users can customize their channel settings and keys.
Meshtastic devices have low power consumption and can last for days on a single battery or be extended with a solar cell.
These are extensible and can be used for various applications, such as environment monitoring, heat mapping, or encrypted messaging.
These devices also have clients for Android, iOS, Mac, Web Browser, and Linux (coming soon) , which allow users to connect and configure their devices easily.
